Although the Master Ethereal teaches Lu Dongbin and He Xiangu Weiqi to guide them to their path, the two disciples fail to understand their master's meaning: Lu Dongbin cannot stand losing, while He Xiangu can never bring herself to sacrifice a single stone. The Master Ethereal finally tells the two disciples to go and meet other masters of Weiqi in the hopes that they will finally achieve enlightenment. In the lands of Chen, where the two begin their ruthless winning streak, Lu Dongbin and He Xiangu win round after round of Weiqi. Their pride in their countless victories leads them to hear rumors of an expert of the name of Hansung, whom they challenge at once. Although the match between the two Saints and Hansung continues for three days and three nights, victory falls to no one. When Lu Dongbin and He Xiangu, struck with his skill, ask Hansung how an \"ordinary human\" can play Weiqi so well, the wise warrior tells them to go to Hero Town - where they shall find their answer.",
